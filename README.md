ECE 385 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign final project report.

Partner on project: Putra Firmansyah (github: pdf21)

This is the project through implementing the space invaders game on our DE-10 Lite FPGA board. We utilized both hardware and software implementations to control the output
of the game, namely we used the hardware logic through SystemVerilog to control the on screen logic and the VGA controller. The software side is written in C and this
interfaces to the keyboard input used to control our game.
